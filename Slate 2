Here is the **final one-page report**, written exactly in the revised layout and fully based on the Excel data you shared.
Formatted as clean text so you can paste directly into a slide or document.

# **SECURE SCORE – OUTSTANDING ACTION SUMMARY**

---

## 🔲 **BOX 1 — AT A GLANCE**

* **Outstanding actions:** 56
* **Categories:** Apps (43), Identity (8), Data (5)
* **Regressions:** 1
* **License blockers:** 1

---

## 🔲 **BOX 2 — CATEGORY BREAKDOWN**

| Category         | Count                           | Typical Controls                                                              |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Apps (43)**    | Majority of outstanding actions | Email security, anti-phishing, sharing controls, Safe Links, Teams governance |
| **Identity (8)** | Fewer items, higher impact      | MFA, identity risk policies, admin session controls                           |
| **Data (5)**     | Smallest set                    | DLP, sensitivity labels, auto-labeling                                        |

---

## 🔲 **BOX 3 — HIGHEST-VALUE OUTSTANDING ITEMS**

1. **Impersonation protection suite**
   *(Multiple 8-point actions: intelligence, domain/user protection, threshold configuration)*

2. **Identity Protection risk policies**
   *(7-point items, including a regressed sign-in risk policy)*

3. **Phishing-resistant MFA for administrators**
   *(7-point security requirement not yet implemented)*

4. **Impersonation quarantine policies**
   *(6-point actions for domain and user impersonation quarantines)*

5. **On-prem Active Directory password protection**
   *(6-point hardening control currently unaddressed)*

---

## 🔲 **BOX 4 — RISK THEMES**

* **Impersonation Exposure:**
  Missing intelligence-based detection, impersonation protection, threshold hardening, and quarantine actions leave users vulnerable to spoofing and targeted phishing.

* **Identity Assurance Gaps:**
  Disabled risk policies (including one regression), incomplete MFA deployment, and lack of phishing-resistant admin authentication weaken identity boundaries.

* **Collaboration/Data Drift:**
  Weak email hygiene (Safe Links, forwarding), permissive sharing configurations, ungoverned Teams settings, and the absence of DLP and labeling controls reduce data governance maturity.

---

## 🔲 **BOX 5 — NEXT STEPS (30-DAY FOCUS)**

* **Deploy impersonation and email protection controls** to strengthen anti-phishing coverage across Exchange and Teams.
* **Restore and enforce identity risk protections**, complete MFA rollout, and require strong authentication for admin roles.
* **Establish data protection baselines** by enabling DLP, publishing sensitivity labels, and configuring initial auto-labeling policies.

If you’d like, I can now generate:

* a more polished *executive-style* wording,
* a shorter “email-ready” version,
* or a version with icons and callouts for PowerPoint.
