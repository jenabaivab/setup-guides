Yeah, that question does overlap with the earlier ones—but it’s a good opportunity to be forward-looking and tie everything together. Here's a clean, thoughtful response you can use for “What are my goals for the next 6 months?”:

"Over the next six months, my main goal is to strengthen the speed–quality balance in my work, especially as I take on more projects with tight timelines or shifting scopes. I want to deliver faster without losing structure or depth, and be more decisive about when something is ‘good enough’ versus when it needs further iteration. I also aim to build more confidence in cross-functional settings—by asking sharper questions early, aligning expectations more clearly, and contributing more actively to the strategic framing of content. Finally, I plan to deepen my expertise in emerging areas like AI governance and APAC regulations, so I can provide sharper insights and expand the value I bring to both clients and internal teams."

Want to add a goal related to career growth or a promotion track? I can help shape that into this as well.
