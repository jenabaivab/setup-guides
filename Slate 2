At the core of ACA’s M&A Due Diligence service is the RealRisk Framework, a proprietary methodology that quantifies risk across IT, cybersecurity, and privacy domains. RealRisk enables deal teams to quickly understand a target’s control maturity, exposure, and overall readiness—transforming technical findings into clear, data-driven insight.

The framework evaluates six domains—Application & Product Security, Detection, Governance, People & Processes, Preparedness & Response, and Protection—covering the full spectrum of technology and security operations. Each domain is scored on a 1–100 scale, producing both domain-level and overall results that highlight key strengths, weaknesses, and potential remediation costs.

RealRisk also links pre-deal diligence to post-deal oversight. Scores and findings can be integrated into ACA’s Vantage for Cyber platform, allowing firms to track improvements and monitor risk across their portfolios after acquisition.
