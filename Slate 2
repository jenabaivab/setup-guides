ACA’s M&A Due Diligence evaluates a target company’s technology and security posture through three interconnected lenses—IT, Cybersecurity, and Privacy—to deliver a complete picture of operational resilience and risk exposure. The combined assessment identifies vulnerabilities that may affect deal value, post-close integration, and long-term portfolio stability.

Our diligence covers:

IT

Evaluation of IT infrastructure, architecture, and operations to identify risks that could impact scalability, reliability, or cost.

Review of system management, vendor dependencies, and disaster recovery capabilities.

Assessment of technology governance, change management, and alignment with business strategy.

Cybersecurity

Review of cybersecurity policies, controls, and incident response readiness.

External assessment of the target’s network perimeter and online presence.

Analysis of security culture, staffing, and control implementation maturity.

Privacy

Review of privacy frameworks, policies, and data protection procedures.

Evaluation of compliance posture with key privacy regulations and contractual requirements.

Examination of data handling practices, breach response, and cross-border transfer controls.

Each component is assessed in coordination to provide a unified risk profile—ensuring findings are contextualized across technology, security, and compliance domains rather than reviewed in isolation. This integrated approach allows deal teams to pinpoint material risks, estimate remediation costs, and make informed investment decisions with speed and confidence.
