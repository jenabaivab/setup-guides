Private equity firms are under increasing pressure from investors, regulators, and portfolio stakeholders to identify and quantify technology-related risks before closing a deal. In today’s landscape, cybersecurity breaches, operational IT weaknesses, and privacy non-compliance can all materially affect valuation, delay integration, or expose the acquiring firm to unexpected costs and reputational harm.

As deal timelines accelerate, many firms are realizing that traditional due diligence often overlooks critical IT, cybersecurity, and privacy factors. Without a structured, data-driven approach to evaluating these areas, acquirers risk inheriting unseen vulnerabilities or technology debt that can erode deal value immediately post-close.
