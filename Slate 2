Here’s a strong draft you can use for your response to "What are the training and skills I will focus on to develop in my career?"—tailored to your role and trajectory:

"Looking ahead, I want to deepen both my subject-matter expertise and strategic communication skills to better support thought leadership and client-facing work. On the technical side, I plan to expand my understanding of cybersecurity frameworks and regulations, especially in the EU and APAC regions, to be able to quickly interpret regulatory shifts and translate them into meaningful insights for clients. I’m also exploring opportunities to upskill in areas like operational resilience, third-party risk, and AI governance, which are increasingly relevant to our offerings. On the content side, I want to refine my narrative-building skills further—whether for complex regulatory explainers, product communications, or executive-facing materials. I also aim to be more confident in stakeholder engagement, particularly during collaborative cross-functional projects, by improving my ability to ask sharper questions and guide content strategy. These skills will help me take on more ownership and increase my impact in both research and delivery."
