Here’s a thoughtful and honest draft for “What are the areas I need to continue to improve upon in my role?”—based on your workstyle and growth themes so far:

"While I’ve made clear progress this year, there are still areas I want to continue improving to be more effective in my role. One key area is efficiency—specifically being able to move faster from research to delivery without compromising quality. I sometimes spend more time than necessary refining structure or language, and I’m working on setting clearer boundaries on how much time each task needs. Another area is being more proactive in cross-functional collaboration. While I’ve become more comfortable owning content, I want to get better at initiating check-ins, clarifying expectations early, and influencing direction when multiple teams are involved. Lastly, I want to improve my ability to zoom out and frame my work in the broader context of client needs and firm strategy—so that every piece I deliver is not just accurate and polished, but also aligned with our business goals."

Let me know if you’d like this worded more conservatively or assertively depending on how your review process leans.
