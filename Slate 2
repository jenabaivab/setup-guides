Thanks, Baivab—here's the revised version without the DORA reference and with the inclusion of your work on the four tearsheets:

"This year I had planned to be more punctual in my work deliveries and improve on my quality of work as a whole. So far, I believe I’ve made steady and measurable progress. I’ve been more consistent with timelines, even when managing multiple priorities, and have developed better habits around task planning and time management. A good example is the completion of four client-facing tearsheets this year, each of which required a clear, concise distillation of complex regulatory or service-related content under tight deadlines. I also led the creation of both the high-level and detailed user guides for the Risk Program Manager feature within Vantage for Cyber, striking a balance between strategic clarity and practical guidance. My explainer on the UK Data (Use and Access) Act 2025 involved quick turnaround and high factual accuracy, which I was able to deliver while maintaining quality and tone consistency. In addition, I’ve been actively refining our Protect pitch deck to better align with emerging client pain points like increased investor scrutiny, while ensuring that the value proposition remains sharp and actionable. Across all these projects, I’ve focused on improving the clarity, structure, and usefulness of the final output, while continuously incorporating feedback and iterating faster."

Let me know if you'd like to add a sentence about collaboration or cross-functional work—happy to tweak further.
