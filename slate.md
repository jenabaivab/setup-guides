**Trend 2: Ransomware...Yes, It’s Still a Threat**

Despite years of awareness and investment, ransomware remains on of the most disruptive and costly cyber threats.

Attackers are becoming increasingly selective, targeting companies which have the most to lose and exfiltrating data before they encrypt it.

The real damage now comes from exposure and extortion, turning every incident into a reputational crisis.

Only 54% of incidents used backups to restore encrypted data in 2025, the lowest rate in six years.


**Coinbase Breach: Insider Bribery as Attack Vector**

A small group of Coinbase support agents were bribed to steal customer data, including names, addresses, and ID documents, and attempted to extort $20 million.

Agents manually photographed sensitive customer records with their phones while using legitimate support tools, collecting data before detection.

Approximately 69,000 users had personal and ID information exposed, leading to regulatory scrutiny and serious reputational damage. Coinbase reported estimated losses to be around $180-$400 million.

**What Went Wrong?**

Insider bribery exploited human trust, not technical vulnerabilities.

No monitoring for physical exfiltration like photos or screenshots.

Delayed detection allowed data collection before alerts were triggered.

**Lessons Learned**

Train staff to report bribery or suspicious requests immediately.

Implement policies to limit and monitor handling of sensitive digital records.

Track unusual support activity, such as high-volume access or printing/export attempts.

Include insider-threat scenarios in incident response planning.

**Marks & Spencer Ransomware Attack**

Marks & Spencer experienced a ransomware attack in April 2025 that took their online sales offline and compromised sensitive customer data.

Attackers gained access by socially engineering a third-party helpdesk employee and then deployed ransomware after stealing admin credentials.

The breach resulted in an estimated £300 million in lost profits and widespread customer data exposure, damaging the brand’s trust. Online stores couldn’t take new orders for more than a month.

**What Went Wrong?**

Lack of robust verification processes for helpdesk requests.

Over-reliance on third-party service providers without adequate security measures.

Inadequate monitoring for unusual access patterns and data exfiltration techniques.

**Lessons Learned**

Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all remote access points.

Establish and enforce strict access controls and least privilege principles.

Conduct ongoing simulated phishing training to improve staff vigilance.
