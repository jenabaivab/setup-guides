**DFSA & FSRA Gap Analysis**

**Introduction**

Financial institutions in the UAE are facing heightened expectations to strengthen their cybersecurity posture. The Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA) in the DIFC has already established comprehensive cyber risk management requirements, while the Financial Services Regulatory Authority (FSRA) in ADGM is rolling out a similar framework, with compliance expected by January 2026. Together, these regulations require firms to maintain robust governance, proactive risk management, and effective controls to safeguard critical information and ICT assets.

Navigating the nuanced differences between DFSA and FSRA requirements can be challenging, particularly for firms operating across both jurisdictions. While both regulators emphasize governance, incident response, and third-party oversight, they differ in aspects such as incident notification timelines and the scope of ICT service provider obligations. Early alignment and remediation are critical to ensure firms meet current obligations and are well-prepared for evolving regulatory expectations.

**ACA’s Structured, Actionable Approach to Regulatory Compliance**

ACA helps financial institutions navigate the complexity of DFSA and FSRA requirements, providing a clear, regulator-ready view of their cybersecurity programs. Our structured approach goes beyond a simple checklist: we evaluate existing policies, controls, and governance frameworks, map them against both regulators’ expectations, and identify actionable gaps. By prioritizing findings based on regulatory urgency, operational impact, and business relevance, ACA ensures that remediation efforts are focused, effective, and aligned with broader cyber resilience objectives. This methodology gives firms clarity, confidence, and a practical roadmap to achieve compliance across jurisdictions.

To deliver this insight in a structured and actionable way, ACA follows a five-step gap analysis process:

1. **Scope Definition** – We collaborate with stakeholders to define the applicable regulatory obligations, business entities, and ICT services within the DFSA and FSRA frameworks.
2. **Policy and Control Review** – Existing cybersecurity policies, processes, and controls are evaluated against regulatory expectations to identify strengths and weaknesses.
3. **Gap Identification** – Deficiencies are mapped, including areas such as incident response procedures, governance documentation, and third-party oversight, highlighting both overlaps and divergences between DFSA and FSRA.
4. **Gap Prioritization** – Findings are ranked according to regulatory urgency, risk exposure, and potential business impact, enabling clients to focus on the most critical compliance gaps first.
5. **Remediation Roadmap** – We provide a detailed, actionable plan with recommendations, timelines, and accountability assignments, equipping firms to address gaps efficiently and demonstrate compliance to regulators with confidence.

Through this structured approach, ACA enables institutions to not only meet current regulatory obligations but also establish a foundation for ongoing cyber resilience and readiness for evolving regulatory expectations.

**Why This Matters: Overlaps and Gaps**

Although DFSA and FSRA share the goal of strengthening cybersecurity in financial services, their requirements diverge in key areas that can create compliance blind spots for firms operating across both jurisdictions.

| Aspect                | DFSA                                           | FSRA                                                  |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Governance            | Board-approved cybersecurity policies required | Emphasis on overall ICT risk management and oversight |
| Incident Response     | 72-hour notification                           | 24-hour notification                                  |
| Third-party Oversight | Focused on key vendors                         | Broader scope, including ICT service providers        |
| Regulatory Focus      | Local DIFC operations                          | ADGM operations, with alignment to global standards   |

While the table highlights the regulatory differences, firms often face challenges translating these requirements into practical, day-to-day controls. Even organizations with established policies may discover gaps that leave them exposed to scrutiny. In our experience, common areas where gaps arise include:

* **Incident response procedures that are untested or undocumented:** Many firms have plans on paper but lack formal testing or board-level approval, which can slow response during a real incident.
* **Limited oversight of third-party ICT vendors:** Firms often focus on critical vendors only, leaving other ICT service providers unassessed, which can expose hidden risks.
* **Policy misalignment with regulatory expectations:** Existing cybersecurity policies may be based on global frameworks (e.g., ISO, NIST) but not fully tailored to DFSA and FSRA requirements.
* **Inconsistent governance practices:** Roles, responsibilities, and reporting structures are sometimes unclear, making it difficult to demonstrate regulatory compliance.
* **Gaps in monitoring and control effectiveness:** Even implemented controls may not be regularly reviewed or tested, creating potential blind spots in ongoing risk management.

Identifying these gaps is only the first step. The real value comes from turning this insight into action — strengthening policies, clarifying responsibilities, and ensuring controls work as intended. Firms that take a structured, informed approach can navigate the nuances of DFSA and FSRA requirements with confidence, while building a more resilient cybersecurity program for the long term.
