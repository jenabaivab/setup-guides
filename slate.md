Trend 2: Ransomware…Yes, It’s Still a Threat

🟣 Despite years of awareness and investment, ransomware remains one of the most disruptive and costly cyber threats.

> Even with stronger defenses and increased spending, ransomware continues to cause major interruptions in operations and force organizations into crisis mode.



🟣 Attackers are becoming increasingly selective, targeting companies which have the most to lose and exfiltrating data before they encrypt it.

> This shift toward “high-value targets” means attackers now look for leverage, not just disruption—focusing on organizations where data exposure would cause maximum reputational or regulatory fallout.



🟣 The real damage now comes from exposure and extortion, turning every incident into a reputational crisis.

> The negotiation is no longer about restoring access; it’s about protecting brand credibility, customer trust, and regulatory exposure.



📉 Only 54% of incidents used backups to restore encrypted data in 2025, the lowest rate in six years.

> This shows that even when backups exist, many companies are still forced into difficult decisions because attackers hold the company’s reputation hostage.



➡ Transition: Let’s look at how ransomware-style extortion is evolving beyond malware — starting with a case where the entry point wasn’t a system exploit but a human one.

📍Case 1: Coinbase Breach – Insider Bribery as an Attack Vector

✅ WHAT HAPPENED

1. A small group of Coinbase support agents were bribed to steal customer data and attempt a $20 million extortion.

> Attackers bypassed technology by directly influencing people with privileged access, proving that motivated insiders can be more dangerous than external hackers.



2. Agents manually photographed customer records using their phones while using approved support tools.

> Since the activity looked like normal account assistance, the physical exfiltration method avoided triggering automated detection.



3. Approximately 69,000 users had personal ID data exposed, leading to regulatory scrutiny and an estimated $180–$400 million impact.

> The fallout wasn’t just financial — it led to investigations, legal exposure, and long-term customer trust issues.




---

⚠️ WHAT WENT WRONG

1. Human trust, rather than system vulnerabilities, was exploited.

> The core weakness was the ability to manipulate insiders rather than break through infrastructure.



2. There were no controls to prevent or detect physical capture of sensitive data.

> Screenshots and photographs bypassed monitoring tools designed for digital transfers.



3. Detection lag allowed extended access and data harvesting before alarms were raised.

> The absence of real-time behavioral monitoring meant risk signals were not escalated early enough.




---

✅ LESSONS LEARNED

1. Staff must be encouraged and equipped to report bribery attempts.

> Insider risk increases when employees lack channels for escalation or fear consequences.



2. Access to sensitive data should be controlled with policies that restrict visibility and monitor how it is handled.

> Even support interactions involving sensitive data should be safeguarded with stricter rules and tracking.



3. Anomalous access behaviors, including repeated view or export of identity records, must be monitored closely.

> Signatures of intent can be detected if behavioral analytics are applied to support environments.



4. Insider threat simulations and response plans should be incorporated into incident playbooks.

> Organizations should prepare for scenarios in which attackers do not break in, but are invited in by insiders.

🛡️ HOW COINBASE RESPONDED (ADDED)

> Coinbase launched a formal investigation, terminated compromised access, disclosed the incident publicly, and offered remediation support to affected users while reinforcing internal controls.




---

🚨 WHY THIS IS SCARY FOR OTHER FIRMS (ADDED)

> Any company relying on large support teams or outsourced customer service is exposed. If a single employee with access can be bribed, then trust becomes a liability, not just an asset.




---

➡ TRANSITION

Next, we move to a more traditional ransomware attack, but one that demonstrates just how devastating a prolonged disruption can be to brand reputation and business operations.


---

📍Case 2: Marks & Spencer Ransomware Attack

✅ WHAT HAPPENED

1. Marks & Spencer suffered a ransomware attack in April 2025 that took online operations offline and exposed customer data.

> The attack didn’t just affect systems; it brought digital revenue channels to a complete halt.



2. Attackers gained access by socially engineering a third-party helpdesk employee and stealing admin credentials before deploying ransomware.

> A vendor employee became the weakest link, turning a support interaction into a bridge for full network access.



3. The breach led to an estimated £300 million loss in profits, widespread customer data exposure, and over a month of halted online sales.

> Customers couldn’t transact, confidence eroded, and the company struggled to recover from prolonged digital downtime.




---

⚠️ WHAT WENT WRONG

1. Helpdesk requests lacked strict authentication checks.

> A convincing story was enough to gain privileged access without additional barriers.



2. Over-reliance on third-party providers created access risk that was not fully governed.

> Vendor access was treated as trusted without equal scrutiny or monitoring.



3. Unusual access patterns and data movements were not flagged early enough to prevent escalation.

> The absence of proactive behavioral monitoring allowed the adversary time to stage encryption.




---

✅ LESSONS LEARNED

1. All remote access, including vendor support channels, must be protected by strong multi-factor authentication.

> Trust in external providers cannot replace technical validation.



2. Access privileges must be limited to what is strictly necessary and continuously reviewed.

> Least privilege is critical in environments where third parties have touchpoints.



3. Regular phishing and social engineering resilience testing remains vital.

> Employees and vendor staff should be tested not for knowledge, but for decision-making under manipulation.




---

🛡️ HOW MARKS & SPENCER RESPONDED (ADDED)

> Marks & Spencer initiated recovery procedures, restored systems gradually, and issued customer communications while strengthening access controls and third-party governance.




---

🚨 WHY THIS IS SCARY FOR OTHER FIRMS (ADDED)

> If your revenue pipeline relies on digital platforms, even a temporary outage can become a financial crisis. And if a vendor can be manipulated, your defenses are only as strong as their training and oversight.




---

➡ TRANSITION

In the next trend, we shift focus from direct attacks to risks that arise when the ecosystem itself becomes an entry point.
