Absolutely. Let’s revise it with:
	1.	More content – expand on each alert and include all five pieces you shared.
	2.	Less technical tone – keep it professional, but accessible for non-technical readers.
	3.	More client-facing framing – emphasize what this means for firms, risks to watch, and practical takeaways.

🔔 Key Alerts & Research Highlights

1. SEC Impersonation Campaign Targets Financial Firms
A new phishing campaign is actively impersonating the SEC. Attackers are sending fraudulent emails pretending to be from the SEC’s Chief Information Office, pressuring users to “verify” their information. These emails use lookalike domains and credible language to lure users into clicking.
Why it matters: Firms should remind employees that regulators do not ask for sensitive data via email links. Consider alerting staff, reviewing email filtering tools, and updating security awareness training.

2. Google Gemini Vulnerability Exposes New AI-Driven Phishing Risks
A recently disclosed vulnerability in Google’s AI-powered email assistant (Gemini) shows how cybercriminals can manipulate AI-generated summaries to mislead users. Invisible instructions hidden in email formatting can be used to change how content is summarized—tricking users into clicking phishing links.
Why it matters: This is a clear example of how generative AI can introduce new, less visible risks. Firms should evaluate AI features in workplace tools and reinforce user awareness.

3. Microsoft SharePoint Vulnerability—Widespread Exploitation Reported
A serious vulnerability affecting on-premise Microsoft SharePoint was found to be exploited by nation-state attackers. The flaw could allow unauthorized access to data or even full system compromise. Patches are now available and should be applied immediately.
Why it matters: SharePoint remains widely used by firms for internal data sharing. If your organization runs an on-premise version, ensure your IT team has applied updates and reviewed system access logs.

4. Rethinking Penetration Testing: Why Leading Firms Are Shifting to Continuous Models
Traditional pen testing remains valuable, but more firms are now adopting continuous testing models (like Penetration Testing as a Service, or PTaaS) to monitor evolving risks. This shift offers more real-time visibility and aligns better with today’s compliance expectations.
Why it matters: A once-a-year test may not reflect your current risk exposure. A continuous approach provides better coverage and more useful insights for risk committees and boards.
