Risk assessments are a central component of any cyber program. They are an essential activity that helps firms meet regulatory expectations, identify and mitigate program gaps to reduce the likelihood of cyber incidents, and help the organization prioritize its resources towards the most important activities. Without a cyber risk assessment, firms are missing an important tool to better manage risk.

After completing your cyber risk assessment, there are a few key steps to take to maximize the value of your results. Those include: 
»	Prioritize risks to be addressed based on risk level and your available resources. 
»	Create a Risk Treatment Plan to determine what risks can be avoided, mitigated, transferred, or accepted by your organization. 
»	Document your risks and treatment plans in a risk register. 
»	Remember to routinely reassess risks throughout the year. 

Step-by-Step Breakdown: 

	Prioritizing Risks
Now that the risks affecting your organization have been identified, you must determine what risks to be prioritized for remediation. In prioritizing what risks to address, you must consider the risk levels associated with your assessment findings (ranked as high, medium, or low risk by our experts), your available resources, the time and cost associated with remediating vulnerabilities, and your organizations appetite for different categories of risk (e.g. some companies might prioritize findings presenting reputational risk over technical or operational risks). 

	Creating  a Risk Treatment Plan
Once  you have prioritized your findings, you must develop a treatment plan for how to address these risks. It is important to remember that not all identified risks need to be remediated. It is up to your organization to set a treatment plan which reflects your needs. Risks may be treated in 4 ways: 

»	Avoid.  Eliminate what creates the risk in the first place. This treatment is usually extended to risks that simply are not necessary for a firm to take on, or the most significant risks. For example, if an organization was considering allowing access to company email on personal mobile devices, they might decide the risk is too great and not allow such access. 

»	Mitigate. Take steps to reduce the likelihood and/or impact of a vulnerability being exploited. For the email on personal devices example, a company might require employees to install “mobile device management” software on their devices that lets the company enforce policies such as encryption on the phone, PIN requirements, screen locks, or device wiping capabilities which would greatly reduce the impact of a lost device. 

»	Transfer. Move the risk to a third party. Typically, this involves purchasing insurance, although it can also include contractual agreements with third parties to be responsible for the risks they create. Using the email example, an organization could ensure that their cyber insurance policy would cover a breach caused by employee use of personal devices. 

»	Accept (also called Retain). Take no action and leave the risk as-is. Ideally the organization has a documented risk appetite/risk tolerance guideline that dictates the risks which the organization may accept, or the process for having risks accepted.

	Documenting Your Risks and Treatment Plans Using a Risk Register
A risk register is a tool to document risk identification and treatment. ACA’s ComplianceAlpha®, where your findings are documented, is a dedicated tool that can serve as a risk register. The risk register allows your organization to track the workflows around risk treatment, as well as to provide evidence to stakeholders and regulators that risks are being properly managed.  
A risk entry in the risk register should include: the classification of the risk and its prioritization level, date identified, treatment plans including target date for treatment, ownership of the treatment plan, expected residual risk to be accepted after treatment, and status of treatment plan. Risk registers should be regularly updated to reflect changes in vulnerabilities and risk levels.

	Reassessing Your Risks
Firms should routinely reassess risks, at least annually and in response to internal and external changes to your organization, including new business deals such as mergers or acquisitions, updated management procedures, or novel software or security tool usage. Reassessing risks periodically ensures your firm can protect itself from incidents.
