🔔 Key Alerts & Research Highlights

1. SEC Impersonation Campaign Targeted Financial Firms
A phishing campaign actively impersonated the SEC by distributing fraudulent emails claiming to be from the Commission’s Chief Information Office. Recipients were asked to “verify” their information via spoofed domains.
Why it mattered: The campaign reinforced the importance of employee awareness, vigilant email filtering, and skepticism around regulatory requests delivered by email.

2. Google Gemini Vulnerability Introduced AI-Driven Phishing Risks
A disclosed vulnerability in Google Gemini for Workspace enabled hidden prompts to influence AI-generated email summaries. These manipulations could redirect users to phishing links through misleading summaries.
Why it mattered: The incident highlighted how generative AI tools may introduce subtle risks—especially when users rely on AI-generated content for decision-making.

3. Microsoft SharePoint Vulnerabilities Required Urgent Patching
A critical vulnerability affecting on-premise SharePoint servers (2016, 2019, and Subscription Edition) was linked to active exploitation by advanced threat groups. Microsoft issued urgent patches, along with guidance on security controls.
Why it mattered: SharePoint remained widely used in internal operations. Unpatched systems could expose firms to unauthorized access or system compromise.

4. Rethinking Penetration Testing: Leading Firms Adopted Continuous Models
More organizations began shifting from traditional point-in-time penetration testing toward continuous testing models such as PTaaS (Penetration Testing as a Service) and CTEM.
Why it mattered: This shift reflected a growing need for real-time threat visibility and testing approaches aligned with regulatory expectations and modern attack patterns.
