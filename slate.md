**Trend 3: Third-Party Vendor Trust Becoming Riskier**

Outsourced vendors and service partners remain the easiest entry point for cybercriminals targeting enterprise networks.

Attackers exploit legitimate access rather than breaking in, turning trusted relationships into attack vectors.

Weak vendor oversight and delayed detection often mean companies discover breaches only after the damage is done.

30% of breaches in the past year involved third-party software vulnerabilities.

**Telemessage Breach: When “Secure” Messaging Isn’t**

An attacker hacked into TeleMessage's infrastructure, gaining access to unencrypted archived messages and contact information from U.S. government officials and major financial institutions.

The attacker discovered and exploited a publicly accessible system endpoint, allowing for the rapid extraction of sensitive data.

The breach exposed communications from over 60 U.S. government officials, including personnel from FEMA, the Secret Service, and at least one White House staffer.

**What went wrong**

Sensitive archives were accessible through an unprotected system endpoint.

Archived messages were not fully encrypted.

Backend systems lacked monitoring for unusual access patterns.

**Lessons Learned**

Avoid exposing critical management or admin interfaces in production environments.

Ensure end-to-end encryption for all communications, including archived messages.

Regularly audit and secure backend infrastructure to prevent unauthorized access.
