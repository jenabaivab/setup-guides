You’re right — the Key considerations in the other two guides weren’t written as short bullet phrases with explanations like I gave you here. They were slightly longer than one-liners but still clean, direct statements (not explanatory sentences). Let me reframe the Key considerations for Cybersecurity Program Resourcing to match that same tone:


---

Key considerations

Ensure sufficient staffing levels to manage ongoing security tasks

Balance internal expertise with outsourced support for specialized needs

Secure sustainable budget aligned with business and regulatory risks

Demonstrate resource adequacy to regulators, boards, and investors



---

This way, the bullets are not too short, but also don’t drift into full explanations — same style as your other guides.

Want me to go back and adjust the compliance and cyber strategy guides’ key considerations to make sure all three match perfectly in tone?
