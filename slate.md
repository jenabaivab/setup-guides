Here are the instructions in the group chat

So we already have a M&A tear sheet. I think the main objective here is to incorporate language on how we assess targets from an IT, Cyber, and / or privacy lens. Currently IT is missing from the convo. I can share some scope descriptions that can help provide clarity on what IT DD includes. But from my pov, we likely won't have to start from scratch but rather iterate on what we have

A few initial thoughts on how to improve - 
To be consistent with industry, let's rename throughout to M&A DD rather than pre-deal
Let's better frame / emphasize why us vs competitors - industry expertise / dedicated portco practice, ability to respond and move quickly alongside deal movements, proprietary risk methodology
Call out the three flavors of M&A - privacy, Tech, Cyber and a high-level overview of scope for each

I'll share descriptions of each service here:

Cyber: 
ACA will conduct an off-site assessment of the current Cybersecurity program status of the acquisition target (the “Company”) using ACA’s proprietary RealRisk methodology. ACA will provide a readout and report, including prioritized recommendations for remediation with estimated costs. Please refer to the Appendix for full scope details.  
 
Delivery:  
The off-site cybersecurity diligence review of the Company includes:  
A review of Company cybersecurity related documentation provided, and publicly accessible information on the Company as it relates to cybersecurity, including an external assessment of the Company’s network perimeter and online presence. 
Remote interviews up to 3 hours with certain cybersecurity, information technology, and/or data protection staff at the Company (the “Assessment Interviews”). 
A call with Client and/or Company to discuss ACA’s findings from the review (the “Findings Call”). 
A written report, detailing RealRisk scores on a scale of 1-100, issues noted, and recommended corrective action (if any) (the “Findings Report”). 
IT:
ACA will conduct an offsite assessment of the current IT capabilities, environment, infrastructure, and operations of the acquisition target (the “Company”) specifically focusing on identifying areas of concern that would likely have a significant impact on cost and risk associated with the acquisition. ACA will provide a readout and report, including prioritized recommendations for remediation with estimated costs. Delivery and output may be conducted in tandem with other Due Diligence Services. Please refer to the Appendix for full scope details.  
 
Delivery:  
The off-site IT diligence review of the Company includes:  
A review of Company IT related documentation provided by Company 
A targeted questionnaire to gather further details to aid in the acceleration of interviews  
Remote interviews up to 3 hours with key personnel to further identify and probe potential risks and concerns (the “Assessment Interviews”). 
A call with Client and/or Company to discuss findings from the review (the “Findings Call”)*. 
A written report, detailing findings and recommended corrective action (if any) (the “Findings Report”)*. 
* The written report and findings call will be combined with Cybersecurity Findings Report and Findings call.

Privacy is essentially same as cyber description, just sub in privacy. So think review of privacy policies and documentation, etc.

These are all the instructions I got from them.
