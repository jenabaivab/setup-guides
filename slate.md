What You’ll Learn: 
This guide outlines key considerations and best practices meant to help firms in selecting and working with managed service providers (MSPs) to enhance or improve their IT capabilities.

Why it Matters: 

With the world’s greater reliance on the digital space and the increasing complexity of IT infrastructure, demand for cost-effective IT solutions has grown world-wide. Small and medium-sized businesses have increasingly relied on managed service providers (MSPs) to bolster their IT capabilities, with the MSP services industry experiencing over a 10% annual rate of growth in 2024. 
While MSPs can present significant benefits, including greater capacity and accessibility to handle gaps in a company’s existing IT competencies, it is essential that companies be considerate in their approach to working with MSPs, to ensure they are not leaving themselves open to unnecessary risks. 

Key Considerations: 
»	Select the MSP most appropriate for your company’s context.
»	Set good communication standards with your MSPs.
»	Maintain strong oversight over your MSPs. 

Basic Tasks: 

	Balance Cost and Service
Before deciding on an MSP, ensure you thoroughly assess your own IT needs and what services you need to determine what MSP pricing model best suits your organization. Your organization’s areas of operation, industry associated risks, size, and available budget should all be considered when it comes to determining what services may be needed. 

	Consider the MSP’s Experience, Expertise, and Scalability
While most MSPs will try to establish their experience and expertise, core competencies and experience areas may always be supplemented by less experienced contractors. Utilize references that align with your company’s industry and size to ensure the MSP’s expertise actually aligns with your needs and growth strategies, to reduce the costs of changing MSPs later. 

	Establish Clear Expectations
Ensure the service level agreement (SLA) between your company and the MSP establishes clear roles and responsibilities, outlines high and low priority issues and their expected response times, and defines a process for how your organization may reach out to the MSP in case of emergency. Setting clear expectations when first establishing an agreement is key to ensuring effective collaboration between your company and your MSPs. 

	Establish Regular Communication
Communicate with the MSP on a regular basis, not just when issues occur. Regular check-ins can be helpful in addressing gaps early and allow the MSP to provide guidance on new and emerging issues. An effective communication model would determine frequency of check-ins, and what reporting would be expected from the MSP. 

	Communicate Security Concerns 
It is important that companies do not assume their use of an MSP fully exempts them from responsibility for IT risks. Instead, companies should ensure they are kept aware of emerging risks and communicate frequently with the MSPs about such risks, their security, and any steps they are taking to ensure their systems are protected against threats. 

Advanced Tasks: 

	Operational Resilience
MSPs serve as a critical line of defense in cybersecurity, incident response, and recovery. Gaps in the MSP’s operational resilience will create significant risks for your organization’s own resilience. It is essential to perform proper due diligence ahead of MSP selection, to address the MSP’s resilience and security posture. Whenever possible, a trusted third party should be used to properly assess the MSP’s capabilities. 

	Share Strategy and Objectives
Transparency is key in the collaborative relationship that must exist between a company and their MSP. To help the MSP understand how their work fits in with your organization’s goals and growth, your strategies and objectives should be clearly communicated. A better understanding on the MSP’s side will allow them to make sure they can address unique opportunities and risks that may affect your organization. 

	Hold MSPs Accountable
MSPs should be regularly evaluated on key metrics such as satisfaction, responsiveness, and speed to resolution. These evaluations must be shared with the MSPs to motivate continuous improvement in the working relationship between the company and the MSP.
