Got it — here’s a slide-ready version with the Impact in a concise, single-sentence format while keeping everything aligned with the Arup/Replit style:

Slide 1 – Coinbase 2025 Breach

Title:
When Insider Bribery Became the Attack Vector

What:
A small group of Coinbase support agents were bribed to steal customer data, including names, addresses, and ID documents, and attempted to extort $20 million.

How:
Agents manually photographed sensitive customer records with their phones while using legitimate support tools, collecting data before detection.

Impact:
Approximately 69,000 users had personal and ID information exposed, leading to regulatory scrutiny and serious reputational damage.

Slide 2 – Lessons from the Inside

What Went Wrong:

Insider bribery exploited human trust, not technical vulnerabilities.

No monitoring for physical exfiltration like photos or screenshots.

Delayed detection allowed data collection before alerts were triggered.


Defensive Takeaways:

Train staff to report bribery or suspicious requests immediately.

Implement policies to limit and monitor handling of sensitive digital records.

Track unusual support activity, such as high-volume access or printing/export attempts.

Include insider-threat scenarios in incident response planning.

If you want, I can also tighten the wording further so the What / How / Impact all fit neatly inside three separate boxes on a slide for a cleaner visual layout. Do you want me to do that?
