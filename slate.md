Securing the Portfolio: Cyber Strategies for PE Sponsors
Private equity (PE) sponsors today must manage the complex challenges of an evolving cybersecurity landscape. However, most firms take an inconsistent approach to cyber oversight, leaving the firm and its portfolio companies exposed to increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks.  For PE sponsors, managing the oversight of this mutating threat landscape effectively requires understanding of risks, gaps in programs, and the resources available to address them.
 To better understand and address these challenges, we have collected data from our proprietary RealRisk scoring model and a survey of PortCo cybersecurity budgets, staffing, and priorities. Join our cybersecurity experts, Matt Grist, Isaac Niedrauer, and Greg Slayton as they reveal findings from these datasets and provide benchmarks and analyses that PE sponsors need to strengthen their oversight practices.
