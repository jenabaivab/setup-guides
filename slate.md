	Assigning Owners, Status, and Timelines (Work-In-Progress)
Every risk needs a responsible party—not just to fix it, but to track progress, escalate issues, and ensure completion. RPM lets you assign primary and secondary owners, remediation deadlines, and status updates such as ‘In Progress’, ‘Completed’, or ‘Paused’. This structure transforms risks from static records into tasks with measurable outcomes. Use this as the basis for internal SLAs—e.g., all “High” risks must move from “Logged” to “Resolved” within 45 days. When ownership is ambiguous or deadlines open-ended, risks often stall indefinitely.
