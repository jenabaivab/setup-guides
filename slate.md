Great — here’s how you could do Trend 4: Identity & Token Compromise, and the NNSA / SharePoint “ToolShell” breach as your case study, in the same tight, executive-friendly style (with numbers where available).

(I’m pulling from public sources; always good to double-check with your own intel.)

🔐 Trend 4 – Identity & Token Compromise as a Primary Attack Vector

Title:
When Identity Becomes the Battlefield

Bullets:

Attackers are increasingly leveraging stolen tokens, session keys, or identity artifacts to bypass perimeter defenses.

Compromised identities (SSO, OAuth tokens) are used for stealthy lateral movement and persistent access.

Weak identity hygiene magnifies the impact: one token leak, and entire networks are exposed.


Scary Stat:
⚠️ In the 2025 “ToolShell” SharePoint campaign, over 400 organizations were compromised via identity/privilege abuses tied to tokens and keys.

🧩 Slide 1 – NNSA / SharePoint “ToolShell” Breach (2025)

Title:
When SharePoint Keys Become the New Keys to the Kingdom

What:
A zero-day vulnerability in on-premises Microsoft SharePoint servers was exploited in July 2025, compromising the networks of over 400 organizations, including the U.S. National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA). 

How:
Attackers exploited the “ToolShell” vulnerability to steal MachineKeys / cryptographic tokens, enabling persistent access and movement across compromised environments. 

Impact:
Over 400 organizations were breached, exposing cryptographic tokens and enabling long-term persistence — even after patches.

🧠 Slide 2 – What Went Wrong & Defensive Takeaways

What Went Wrong:

The attack relied on identity/crypto artifacts (MachineKeys) rather than just credentials.

Many organizations treated machine-level keys as low-risk and didn’t rotate them often.

Detection systems focused on credential usage, not on anomalous token/key behavior.


Defensive Takeaways:

Rotate machine-level keys and tokens regularly, and treat them as first-class security assets.

Apply continuous token use monitoring / anomaly detection (e.g. sudden cryptographic key usage).

Microsegmentation & zero-trust segmentation to limit damage from token-based escalation.

Implement just-in-time access and short-lived tokens to reduce exposure windows.

Include key / token exposure in incident response plans, with procedures to revoke, validate, and rotate compromised artifacts.
