The Cyber Risk Landscape Has Changed — Has Your Program Kept Up? 
Vantage has long empowered private equity sponsors and operating teams with visibility into cyber posture across their portfolios. But visibility is only the first step. Once risks are identified, the real challenge begins:
»	Who owns the follow-up?
»	How is progress tracked?
»	Are issues actually being resolved?
Without a centralized system, PortCos often rely on fragmented methods—spreadsheets, email chains, or internal tools invisible to sponsors. This leads to inconsistent follow-through, unclear accountability, and limited oversight.
Risk Program Manager: A Shared System of Record
Risk Program Manager (RPM) is a new feature integrated into the Vantage platform that enables sponsors and PortCos to collaboratively manage cybersecurity risks within their existing dashboards. It acts as a centralized register where risks—whether identified through Vantage, third-party assessments, or internal reviews—can be logged with key details such as severity, source, remediation plans, and deadlines. This transforms the Vantage assessment from a static snapshot into a dynamic, ongoing workflow.




Each PortCo has its own RPM instance, allowing for tailored risk tracking while maintaining consistency across the portfolio. Sponsors can navigate into individual PortCos to monitor progress, with real-time updates, status changes, and supporting documentation all visible within the platform. While not a unified portfolio-wide view, RPM ensures standardized oversight and accountability, helping stakeholders clearly see what’s being done, by whom, and by when.

Why the RPM Matters

Cybersecurity oversight isn’t just about identifying risks—it’s about ensuring they’re resolved. RPM bridges the gap between assessment and action by embedding accountability into the Vantage platform. Every risk logged in RPM is tied to an owner, a deadline, and a clear remediation path, giving both sponsors and PortCos the structure they need to follow through. 

By centralizing risk tracking, RPM eliminates the confusion of scattered systems and manual updates. Sponsors gain real-time visibility into how risks are progressing across each PortCo, while PortCos benefit from a consistent, transparent process. It fits directly into the oversight process by giving sponsors and PortCos a shared, structured system to assign owners, set deadlines, and track remediation progress without leaving the Vantage platform. Some key benefits include:

Laying the Groundwork for Smarter Oversight

The launch of Risk Program Manager marks a major step forward in how sponsors and PortCos manage cybersecurity risks across the portfolio. By embedding risk tracking, ownership, and resolution directly into the Vantage platform, RPM lays the groundwork for a more structured, transparent, and accountable oversight process from day one.

Whether you're preparing for regulatory scrutiny, responding to investor questions, or simply aiming to improve internal coordination, RPM gives you the tools to act with confidence. It’s ready to use now—fully integrated into your existing dashboards and designed to scale with your needs.

Risk Program Management
Over the years, Vantage has helped private equity sponsors and operating teams evaluate cyber posture across their portfolios. By surfacing gaps, benchmarking maturity, and highlighting key risks, Vantage gave users a real-time snapshot of where their companies stood—and where attention was required. But having visibility into risks wasn’t enough. Sponsors often found themselves asking:
“What happened after the assessment?”
“Who’s responsible for follow-up?”
“Did the PortCo ever fix that?”
PortCos, on the other hand, were left to manage issues through ad hoc methods—spreadsheets, email chains, internal ticketing systems that weren’t visible to sponsors, or worse, no system at all. The result was fragmented accountability, inconsistent follow-through, and limited oversight into whether risks were being resolved.
Clients repeatedly asked for a way to track progress in one place, assign accountability, and maintain a shared system of record—not just for ACA-led findings, but for any cybersecurity risks that emerged from audits, pen tests, or internal discoveries.
That gap led us to build the Risk Program Manager.
What is the Risk Program Manager?
Risk Program Manager (RPM) is a new feature built directly into the Vantage platform. It acts as a centralized register where sponsors and PortCos can collaboratively log cybersecurity risks, assign ownership, and track resolution—all within the context of the existing dashboards.
RPM is designed to turn the Vantage assessment from a static snapshot into a living workflow. When a risk is identified—whether through Vantage, a third-party test, or internal review—it can be added into RPM with details like severity, source, remediation plans, and deadlines. From there, progress can be tracked in real time. Owners can update statuses, log notes, and upload supporting documentation to show how risks are being remediated over time.
Each PortCo has its own RPM instance inside its dashboard. Sponsors with access to multiple PortCos can view risks by navigating into each company individually. While it’s not a single unified view across the entire portfolio, RPM enables sponsors to see risk progress in a consistent, standardized way—no matter which PortCo they’re reviewing.
In effect, RPM transforms risk conversations from “Is this being handled?” to “Here’s what’s being done, by whom, and by when.”
How our RPM Fits into Portfolio Oversight
Our risk program manager extends Vantage’s role from surfacing cybersecurity risks to actively managing their resolution. It fits directly into the oversight process by giving sponsors and PortCos a shared, structured system to assign owners, set deadlines, and track remediation progress—all without leaving the Vantage platform. Some key benefits include:
•	Centralized tracking: All cybersecurity risks—whether identified by ACA, third parties, or internally—can be logged and monitored in one place, reducing confusion and duplication.

•	Clear accountability: Each risk is assigned to an owner with a due date, ensuring that responsibility for remediation is clearly documented.

•	Real-time visibility: Both PortCos and sponsors can see the current status of risks at any time, without waiting for periodic updates or manual reports.

•	Standardized oversight: Risks are tracked in a consistent format across all PortCos, making it easier for sponsors to review progress and spot trends portfolio wide.

•	Audit-ready documentation: RPM provides a historical record of how risks were managed and resolved, helping both PortCos and sponsors demonstrate diligence during audits, investor reviews, or regulatory inquiries.
RPM is not just a record-keeping tool—it’s a way to drive real follow-through, foster accountability, and improve confidence in how cybersecurity risks are addressed across the portfolio.
What’s Next for You?
The Risk Program Manager is intended to serve as a foundation for stronger, more consistent cybersecurity oversight across the portfolio. Over time, we aim to continue enhancing the experience based on client needs and feedback. Our focus remains on helping sponsors and PortCos manage risks more effectively, improve transparency, and maintain accountability – all within the vantage platform.
As cybersecurity risks evolve, so will our tools for managing them.
