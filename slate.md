🧩 Trend 2: Targeted Data Exfiltration & Extortion Economics

Title:
When Stealing Data Became a Business Model

Bullets:

Ransomware groups are evolving into full-fledged “data brokers,” targeting organizations with monetizable data.

Attackers now focus on precision exfiltration — taking just enough to threaten, not to overload.

Extortion campaigns are increasingly multi-phased, combining data leaks, PR pressure, and regulatory threats.


Scary Stat:
💰 Average ransom demands in 2025 exceeded $1.3 million, with 40% of victims hit by follow-up extortion using previously stolen data (Coveware, Q2 2025).

💥 Slide 1 – The Breakdown: Coinbase Breach

Title:
When the Attackers Knew What to Steal

What:
In early 2025, Coinbase suffered a data breach when a financially motivated group exfiltrated a targeted dataset of customer identification documents and internal access credentials.

How:
Attackers used a phishing campaign tailored for Coinbase’s internal support team, gaining limited administrative access. Instead of encrypting systems, they quietly extracted verified customer KYC data — information valuable for identity fraud and resale.

Impact:
Roughly 6,000 customer records were exposed. While funds remained secure, the reputational hit was severe, and the attackers attempted a second extortion round threatening regulatory disclosure.

⚙️ Slide 2 – What Went Wrong & Defensive Takeaways

Title:
Precision Extortion: The New Normal

What went wrong:

Excessive internal access privileges for customer data handling.

Delayed detection of exfiltration due to focus on ransomware indicators.

No pre-defined escalation path for extortion threats involving regulatory pressure.


Key defensive actions:

Tighten data access segmentation — restrict KYC and identity data to need-based roles.

Adopt data exfiltration detection tools that flag low-volume, high-value transfers.

Prepare for double-extortion scenarios with coordinated legal and comms playbooks.

Expand incident simulations to include non-encryption-based extortion models.

Would you like me to now do the Marks & Spencer ransomware case under the same trend, but with a slightly different tone (more business continuity + operational disruption focus)?
