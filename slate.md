Exactly right — for an executive audience, especially in a webinar setting, the takeaways should feel strategic, not technical. They should sound like business imperatives tied to governance, resilience, and accountability — things an executive can act on or assign, not configure.

Here’s a fully refined version of the UNFI / Whole Foods case, tuned for a boardroom tone — same factual accuracy, but simplified into decision-level insights.

Slide 1 – UNFI / Whole Foods Supply Chain Cascade (June 2025)

Title:
When One Breach Disrupts an Entire Industry

What:
In June 2025, food distributor UNFI detected unauthorized activity and took its ordering and logistics systems offline, halting deliveries to major clients including Whole Foods.

How:
The shutdown of a single digital platform triggered a ripple effect across warehouses and retailers, as partners were unable to place or track orders for several weeks.

Impact:
Over 30,000 stores faced supply disruptions and product shortages, with losses estimated between $350–$400 million. It took three weeks for operations to fully resume.

Slide 2 – What Went Wrong & Executive Takeaways

What Went Wrong:

Critical supply-chain systems were concentrated in a single digital platform.

Business continuity planning hadn’t accounted for a full technology shutdown.

Retailers had no alternative procurement paths when UNFI went offline.


Executive Takeaways:

Diversify dependencies: Avoid single-vendor reliance for mission-critical operations.

Demand resilience proof: Require suppliers to demonstrate continuity and cyber-recovery readiness.

Quantify cascade risk: Assess how one vendor outage could affect customer delivery or compliance.

Embed joint response planning: Treat cyber events as shared ecosystem crises, not isolated IT issues.

This version reads cleanly, fits in slide boxes, and hits the right “board-level” tone — no acronyms, no configs, just accountability, interdependence, and resilience.

Would you like me to now help you close the deck with a summary or reflection slide (tying all five trends together)? That’s usually what caps these kinds of webinars powerfully.
