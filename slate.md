Excellent — thanks for the clarification. I’ll keep the structure exactly the same, improve clarity and tone throughout, and polish the flow so it’s a bit more refined and executive-ready. I’ll also expand or trim tasks as needed, rather than sticking to six arbitrarily.

Here’s the refined version of the Cyber Training and User Awareness area guide:

Cyber Training and User Awareness

Human behavior is one of the most common causes of cybersecurity incidents — and one of the hardest to manage. From phishing to accidental data sharing, attackers increasingly target end users because technical defenses often can’t stop someone from clicking a malicious link or falling for a social engineering ploy. For wealth managers, where sensitive financial data, client communications, and regulatory obligations are all in play, poor cyber awareness can quickly translate into reputational damage or regulatory exposure.

A strong training and awareness program helps reduce this risk by shaping secure behavior across the organization. It builds familiarity with threats, reinforces critical policies, and empowers employees to act with caution and confidence. Without it, even well-resourced cybersecurity programs can be undermined by a single mistake.

Once your firm has identified its human-related risks, the following actions can help strengthen awareness and improve overall cyber readiness: »	Establish clear goals aligned to your firm’s risk profile.
»	Select training formats and frequency based on roles and resources.
»	Enforce attendance and measure employee comprehension.
»	Regularly reinforce key messages using practical testing and reminders.
»	Embed secure practices into daily workflows and available tools.
»	Tailor training for high-risk or regulated roles.
»	Use phishing simulations to test real-world response readiness.

Step-by-Step Breakdown

	Set Awareness Goals Based on Risk
Start with clarity: what behavior do you want to change, and why? Review your firm’s risk assessments or incident history to identify top user-driven threats. These might include phishing, improper data handling, weak passwords, or mishandling of sensitive client communications. From there, define what the training program should achieve — and how you’ll measure success over time.

	Choose Formats and Frequency That Fit Your Firm
Cybersecurity training must be practical and sustainable. Most firms offer it during onboarding and then annually. However, employees in higher-risk roles may need more frequent or advanced training. Delivery methods can include web-based modules, live sessions, videos, or quick reference tools. The key is selecting formats that align with employee schedules and your firm’s resourcing capacity.

	Track Participation and Verify Retention
Participation alone isn’t enough. Use tools to track who completes training, and include short quizzes or follow-ups to check for comprehension. Employees who skip sessions or underperform on assessments should be flagged for re-training. Clear, consistent communication about the importance of participation — including support from leadership — can help drive engagement.

	Use Phishing Simulations to Gauge Readiness
Phishing is one of the most common threats facing financial services. Regular, realistic simulations can test whether employees can spot red flags in actual emails. These campaigns should vary in difficulty and target different roles. Review the results to identify trends or problem areas, and follow up with targeted feedback or supplemental training as needed.

	Reinforce Key Messages Throughout the Year
Training shouldn't be a one-time event. Use internal newsletters, email tips, posters, or lunch-and-learns to keep cybersecurity topics fresh. Short reminders on specific threats (e.g. a recent rise in wire fraud or spoofed client emails) can help keep users alert. Consistent messaging helps embed a “security-aware” mindset into the firm’s day-to-day culture.

	Embed Cybersecurity Into Daily Workflows
To change behavior, training must connect to what employees actually do. Highlight tools and processes that support secure behavior — like using a password manager, encrypted email for client communication, or clear steps to report a phishing attempt. The easier these secure options are to follow, the more likely staff are to adopt them.

	Ensure Easy, Visible Reporting Channels
Encourage employees to report suspicious activity, even if they’re unsure. Make sure the process is quick, visible, and reinforced during training. Whether through a dedicated mailbox, helpdesk, or reporting button in email tools, staff should know exactly how and where to raise concerns without fear of negative consequences.

	Tailor Training for High-Risk or Specialized Roles
Some employees — such as client advisors, finance staff, or IT personnel — face more targeted threats due to their access or responsibilities. Provide specialized training based on the risks they’re exposed to, including data protection rules (like GDPR or U.S. state laws), wire transfer protocols, or phishing techniques aimed at high-access accounts.
