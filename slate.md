These are the columns in the table
Cyber Compliance Requirements,	Recommended Frequency,	Policy Reference,	Date Last Completed,	Notes

I provided contents for the first 2 columns, the rest are to be filled by the clients later and maintained.

Now we should create the components based on the headings of the cyber compliance requirements, and get into more detail in their explanations. We just have to make sure the explanations are aligned. We need not mention everything that they have to do in the component explanations, but we must touch up on why we are recommending certain things maybe.  I think around 2 paragraphs is a decent length for each component. We can have bullets in between the explanations for certain parts if they are helpful.

Also, this means that the intro section may need changes, and the "essential actions to be taken" part will also need to be changed to be in accordance with the new components.

Btw, before you draft the entire guide again. Tell me if you think we can combine any of the components together? Totally fine if not viable, because we don't want to mash together for no reason. But if we can, we should save space.
