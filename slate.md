This was my agenda initially.

AI as the Ultimate Attack Accelerator

Targeted Data Exfiltration & Extortion Economics

Trusted Tool and Infrastructure Abuse

Identity & Token Compromise as a Primary Attack Vector

Ecosystem Amplification: Shared SaaS & Supply Chain Cascades

Our Predictions for 2026

I got this comment

I would take another pass through these trends. I don’t think they are “wrong” but I think we can simplify the language on nearly all of them to make the teaching point easier to grasp.
Something like
1) AI-Powered Social Engineering
2) Ransomware Continues to Mature
3) Third Party Trust Creates Cyber Risk
4) Interdependences Amplify Attack Impacts (I would consider rolling the SharePoint incident into this section)
5) Predictions

Personal opinion: We may have to tweak the bullets for them as well to match with the new headings.
