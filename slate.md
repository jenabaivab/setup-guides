Absolutely—great call. Since the SEC impersonation campaign appears to have been contained and isn’t ongoing, it makes sense to shift that section from an active threat alert to a recent example with a broader reminder. I’ve also checked the other alerts and adjusted tense slightly where needed for accuracy and consistency.

Here’s the updated section with your requested changes, along with the others in line with that framing:

🔔 Key Alerts & Research Highlights

1. SEC Impersonation Campaign Highlighted the Risk of Regulator-Themed Phishing
Earlier this summer, a phishing campaign impersonating the SEC circulated fraudulent emails claiming to originate from the Commission’s Chief Information Office. Recipients were asked to “verify” their information via spoofed domains.
Why it mattered: While the campaign has not persisted, it served as a strong reminder of how attackers continue to exploit regulator trust to prompt user action. Firms should ensure staff are aware that regulatory bodies do not request sensitive information via email links and that impersonation risk remains a top threat vector.

2. Google Gemini Vulnerability Introduced AI-Driven Phishing Risks
A recently disclosed vulnerability in Google Gemini for Workspace enabled hidden prompts to influence AI-generated email summaries. These manipulations could have misled users and redirected them to phishing links.
Why it mattered: This incident highlighted how generative AI tools may introduce subtle risks—especially when users rely on automated summaries to assess email content.

3. Microsoft SharePoint Vulnerabilities Required Urgent Patching
In July, a critical vulnerability affecting on-premise SharePoint servers (2016, 2019, and Subscription Edition) was identified and linked to active exploitation. Microsoft released urgent patches and issued specific mitigation guidance.
Why it mattered: SharePoint remained widely used in internal environments. Firms using affected versions were urged to apply updates promptly and review logs for potential compromise.

4. Rethinking Penetration Testing: Leading Firms Adopted Continuous Models
Recent ACA Aponix research explored the shift from annual penetration testing toward continuous testing models such as PTaaS (Penetration Testing as a Service) and CTEM.
Why it mattered: This change reflected growing regulatory expectations and the need for real-time threat visibility across increasingly complex IT environments.
