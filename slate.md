Capturing Timelines, Priorities, and Action Plans
Every risk in RPM is more than a record—it’s a call to action. Firms can create tailored response plans for each risk by logging remediation deadlines, setting priority levels, defining treatment strategies (e.g., accept, mitigate, transfer), and capturing budgeting needs.
Fields like Percent Complete, Risk Treatment, and Status (“In Progress”, “Completed”, “Paused”) allow for transparency, accountability, and momentum. You can use these to set internal SLAs—e.g., all “High” risks must move from “Logged” to “Resolved” within 45 days. The goal is to convert passive risk tracking into measurable, outcome-driven workflows
