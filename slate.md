You're absolutely right — even with short bullets, **Box 4 (Risk Themes)** and **Box 5 (Next Steps)** are still *too tightly linked in meaning*, because both are ultimately about impersonation, identity, and data.

To eliminate this overlap, we need to **change the function** of Box 4 and Box 5 so they:

* talk about *different layers* of the problem,
* use *non-overlapping language*,
* serve *different decision-making purposes*,
* still stay relevant to the dataset.

Below is the **corrected final structure**, with **zero conceptual duplication**.

---

# ⭐ **FINAL NON-REDUNDANT VERSION — Boxes 4 & 5 Fully Differentiated**

## 📌 How this version avoids redundancy:

* **Box 4 = “Why this matters”** (risk implications, impact themes)
* **Box 5 = “What we’ll do about it”** (operational next steps)
* No shared phrasing, no shared categories
* Fits cleanly in half-width boxes

---

# **SECURE SCORE – OUTSTANDING ACTION SUMMARY (Final Clean Version)**

---

## 🔲 **BOX 1 — AT A GLANCE**

* **Outstanding actions:** 56
* **Categories:** Apps (43), Identity (8), Data (5)
* **Regressions:** 1
* **License blockers:** 1

---

## 🔲 **BOX 2 — CATEGORY BREAKDOWN**

| Category         | Count      | Typical Controls           |
| ---------------- | ---------- | -------------------------- |
| **Apps (43)**    | Majority   | Email/Teams, anti-phishing |
| **Identity (8)** | High-value | MFA, risk policies         |
| **Data (5)**     | Minimal    | DLP, labeling              |

---

## 🔲 **BOX 3 — HIGHEST-VALUE OUTSTANDING ITEMS**

1. Impersonation protection suite (8-point items)
2. Identity Protection risk policies (one regressed)
3. Phishing-resistant MFA for admins
4. Impersonation quarantine settings
5. On-prem AD password protection

---

# ⭐ **THE KEY FIX — NON-REDUNDANT BOTTOM ROW**

## 🔲 **BOX 4 — RISK IMPLICATIONS** *(What these gaps expose the org to)*

*(No operational language. No category framing.)*

* **Higher success rate for phishing & spoofing**
* **Weaker detection of compromised accounts**
* **Uncontrolled sharing increases accidental data leaks**

*(This is the “why this matters” box — purely impact-focused.)*

---

## 🔲 **BOX 5 — NEXT STEPS (30-DAY FOCUS)**

*(Purely actions. No reference to risks. No theme repetition.)*

* **Enable impersonation defenses & quarantine flows**
* **Reinstate identity risk policies + complete MFA**
* **Activate baseline DLP and publish sensitivity labels**

*(This is the “what we do next” box — purely actionable.)*

---

# 🎯 **Why THIS Works**

* Box 4 is **impact-only**, not describing gaps or fixes
* Box 5 is **action-only**, not describing risk or context
* There is **zero category overlap**
* No repeated words other than necessary ones (e.g., "impersonation")
* Both fit cleanly into half-width boxes
* Executive-friendly, crisp, and readable

---

If you want, I can now turn this into:

* a **polished PPT-style version**,
* a **minimalist design version**, or
* a version with **visual icons and color cues**.
