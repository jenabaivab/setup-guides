This is the old tearsheet. It was called the cybersec and privacy pre deal due diligence. 

**Gain Critical Insights into the Cybersecurity and Privacy Risks of Potential Acquisitions**

PE firms now face increased pressure from limited 
partners to ensure cybersecurity and privacy risks are 
properly addressed within their portfolios. For most, this 
process starts at acquisition, as deal teams work to define 
and understand the cyber risks related to the company 
being acquired or invested in.  

Pre-deal due diligence, properly performed, allows firms 
to evaluate investment targets, their technology 
readiness to execute a business plan, their cybersecurity 
program quality and efficacy, and their execution and maintenance of privacy compliance. In addition, 
pre-deal due diligence can ensure firms are better prepared to understand any potential remediation 
costs that should be accounted for.  
 
ACA Aponix’s Pre-Deal Due Diligence services for Cybersecurity and Privacy allows firms this and more 
through a comprehensive and efficient cybersecurity assessment, delivered by an experienced team 
that can inform a deal team of any potential pitfalls to be found surrounding cybersecurity and 
privacy. 

What to Expect from ACA Aponix’s Due Diligence Service 
Aponix’s base due diligence offering includes an offsite assessment of the current 
Cybersecurity program of the acquisition target using ACA’s proprietary RealRisk 
methodology.  
The assessment is comprehensive, including extended interviews with 
cybersecurity, information technology and data protection staff, as well as a review 
of company cybersecurity and privacy related documentation as well as any 
publicly accessible information on the company. An external assessment of the 
company’s perimeter and online presence is also part of the assessment.  
From this assessment, ACA Aponix will provide a readout and report, including 
prioritized recommendations for remediation with estimated costs, ensuring firms 
are fully prepared to work with their target companies in mitigating risks and 
ensuring the security of their investment.

ACA’s Unique Approach to Assessing Risk  
ACA's proprietary RealRisk Framework is structured around 6 domains (Governance, 
People & Processes, Protection, Preparedness & Response, Detection, and Application & 
Product Security). Under each domain are sub-domains, which are called "areas", each 
assessing distinct aspects of the company’s cybersecurity and privacy risks. 
The RealRisk assessment methodology produces an overall RealRisk score as well as a 
score for each domain and area within the framework, allowing firms to receive clear 
information on where their target companies may fall short of ideal cybersecurity and 
privacy goals. The scores, ranging from 1 (Low Risk) to 100 (High Risk) allow for easy 
understanding of overall assessment results for a target company.  
The use of ACA Aponix’s RealRisk risk scoring methodology links the Pre-deal due 
diligence product to the Vantage for Cyber offering, facilitating the pursuit of 
cybersecurity portfolio oversight for companies that choose to continue prioritizing 
cybersecurity risk management after the pre-deal phase.
