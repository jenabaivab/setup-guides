Monitoring and detection


Defined 
Monitoring and analysis of event data for abnormal activity, and notification of suspicious activity to enable response

Why it Matters 

With artificial intelligence emerging as tool for threat actors, real-time monitoring and detection of vulnerabilities is of paramount importance for cybersecurity programs. Monitoring and detection tool provide timely and relevant information for decision-making, enabling faster threat detection and response to potential cyber-attacks. They also demonstrate accountability and compliance with laws and regulations, holding employees, partners, and vendors accountable for their security responsibilities. Monitoring and detection also enable learning and improvement, identifying strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and challenges, and adjusting security controls and strategies to meet changing needs and threats.

A Closer Look

•	45% of organizations worldwide are expected to experience an attack on their supply chains by 2025.

•	Notable breach - Marriott's 2018 breach involved a massive data leak compromising millions of customer records. Inadequate monitoring and detection systems failed to promptly identify and respond to suspicious activities, allowing the breach to persist undetected for a long time.

How to Lower Risk 

The following is ACA Aponix’s guidance for how companies can lower their risk in this area:     

Essential Components

	Implementing Detection and Response Tools
Detection and response tools are the key components in identifying potentially malicious or anomalous activity. They can be running on endpoints (e.g. laptops and servers) and on the network (e.g. firewalls or Intrusion detection prevention (IDS/IPS) devices). On endpoints they may be referred to as Anti-Virus (AV) or Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) tools. Fundamentally all of these tools scrutinize activity and events for patterns for unusual or suspicious activities that may indicate a security threat. They provide real-time alerts, enabling prompt responses. Most can be configured to automatically take some level of response when suspicious activity. Organizations should start by assessing network infrastructure, defining security policies, and selecting suitable solutions. When selecting vendors, scalability, real-time monitoring, and regular updates should be things to prioritize. Key to the use of these tools is that their output, in terms of alerts, needs to be monitored so that potential incidents are detected and responded to in a timely manner.




	Incident Response Planning and Training
A well-defined incident response plan outlines the steps to take when a security incident occurs, ensuring a structured and coordinated response. Regular training familiarizes staff with these procedures, enabling swift and effective action. This preparation enhances the organization's ability to detect and respond to incidents promptly. It minimizes confusion, reduces response times, and ensures that the right personnel are equipped to handle the situation. 

	Conducting Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing
Regular security audits and penetration testing bolster organizations' monitoring and detection capabilities by actively assessing their defenses. Security audits evaluate the effectiveness of existing security measures, ensuring compliance with industry standards and policies. Penetration testing simulates real-world cyberattacks to identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses. These proactive measures pinpoint potential entry points for malicious actors.

	Using Threat Intelligence Feeds and Reviewing Alerts 
Threat intelligence feeds are valuable tools for organizations to monitor and detect emerging threats. They provide early warnings of new threats, enabling proactive measures like patch deployment and policy updates. They can also enhance the effectiveness of security tools and solutions by integrating them with existing ones. Additionally, they help organizations investigate and respond to security incidents more quickly and effectively. For instance, they can identify IP addresses associated with known malware botnets, update antivirus software to detect new malware, and identify phishing campaigns targeting organizations. By consistently analyzing events and alerts, organizations can spot unusual patterns or anomalies that may indicate a security breach or unauthorized access.

Advanced Components

	Utilizing SIEM Tools Throughout the Infrastructure
Utilizing Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tools empowers organizations in monitoring and detection by providing a centralized platform to aggregate, correlate, and analyze security events from various sources across the network. It offers a comprehensive view of the organization's security posture in real time. SIEM identifies patterns and anomalies, allowing for early detection of potential threats or breaches. Moreover, it generates alerts and reports, enabling rapid response to security incidents. By leveraging SIEM, organizations can proactively identify and mitigate security risks, enhance incident response capabilities, and maintain a robust security stance, ultimately safeguarding sensitive data and preserving the integrity of their systems and networks. 
	
	Employing Network Traffic Analysis (NTA) Tools
Network analysis tools continuously scrutinize network traffic for suspicious patterns or anomalies, providing real-time insights into potential security threats. By identifying unusual activities or communication patterns, organizations can swiftly pinpoint potential breaches or malicious activities. Additionally, network analysis tools offer the ability to generate alerts, allowing for immediate investigation and response. This proactive approach strengthens an organization's ability to detect and respond to emerging threats, ultimately fortifying the overall cybersecurity posture.


How Do We Get Our Score to be “Green”? 

Users of RealRisk should understand three important points about the RealRisk methodology which are related to achieving a score less than 25. 

First, despite some vendors’ claims to the contrary, it is impossible to quantify cyber risk in absolute terms. All cyber risk assessments, including RealRisk, should be seen as prioritization tools. RealRisk helps identify the likely areas of greatest risk to support prioritization of improvement efforts. Hence, achieving an arbitrary score (such as “green”) may not be in an organization’s best interest.

Second, RealRisk incorporates not only companies’ security posture, but also the inherent risk due to their business context. In certain cases, an organization’s inherent risk may be so high that it is impractical to reduce its score to the bottom quartile of the RealRisk scale. That may just be a fact of life for some companies in certain industries, just as a bank will always be exposed to higher credit risk than a telecom. RealRisk’s utility is in identifying the areas of highest relative risk, both within a company and between companies, so it must be able to reflect the reality of inherent risk.

Finally, in our design of RealRisk, we have purposefully left room for the possibility of over investment in risk reduction. ACA considers scores between 25 and 50, or Light Green, as “Low” risk and likely a satisfactory score for many companies. Scores much less than 25 (Dark Green, or “Very Low”) should prompt consideration as possibly reflecting areas of over investment.
