Communication

What you’ll learn

How to establish clear and effective communication practices that strengthen cybersecurity awareness, response, and trust.

Why it matters

Strong communication is one of the most overlooked aspects of cybersecurity programs. Technical defenses can only go so far if employees, leadership, or third parties do not know how to act when risks emerge. Clear, consistent messaging ensures staff understand their responsibilities, incidents are reported quickly, and leadership has the information it needs to make timely decisions.

Externally, effective communication strengthens trust with clients, regulators, and partners, especially during an incident. Organizations that prepare structured, transparent, and secure communication channels are better able to minimize confusion, reduce reputational damage, and meet disclosure requirements. Without these practices, even small events can escalate into crises that undermine stakeholder confidence.

Key considerations

Define secure and reliable channels for both routine updates and emergencies.

Tailor the level of detail to the audience, from frontline employees to the board.

Embed communication processes into incident response planning.

Balance transparency with discretion in external disclosures.

Reinforce expectations through ongoing awareness efforts and exercises.


Basic Tasks

Define clear reporting and escalation paths.
Employees must know exactly how to report suspicious activity, what details to provide, and who to escalate to. Documenting these paths and training staff on them reduces delays in responding to incidents. Clear reporting structures also help eliminate confusion during crises, where time is often the most valuable resource. Regular reinforcement ensures staff do not forget the process or hesitate when threats arise.

Provide regular, accessible security updates.
Staff engagement with security depends on being kept informed of evolving risks. Short, plain-language updates on phishing campaigns, password policies, or system changes help employees understand threats in context. Making these updates accessible through email, intranet, or town halls prevents knowledge gaps from forming. Consistent updates also signal that cybersecurity is a priority, encouraging staff to take it seriously.

Integrate security messages into daily workflows.
Cybersecurity reminders are more effective when delivered within the tools and platforms employees already use. For example, banners warning about external email senders or chat notifications about phishing attempts keep risks front of mind. This reduces reliance on standalone awareness sessions that staff may overlook. Embedding communication into workflows builds a culture where security becomes second nature.

Brief leadership with risk-focused reports.
Executives require clear, high-level reporting on risks, impacts, and recommended decisions, rather than technical details. By framing updates around business consequences, leadership can make informed choices quickly. Regular reports also demonstrate that cybersecurity is being actively managed, which builds confidence at the board level. Over time, this helps integrate cybersecurity into broader strategic planning.

Include cybersecurity in onboarding and training.
New hires are particularly vulnerable to mistakes if communication about security comes too late. Including reporting channels, escalation contacts, and expectations during onboarding creates a consistent baseline of awareness. Reinforcing these expectations through refresher training helps avoid complacency among longer-tenured staff. Embedding this communication early fosters accountability from day one.

Ensure accessibility of communication.
Not all employees will have access to email or the same devices, so communication must be multi-channel. SMS alerts, printed reminders, or app-based push notifications may be necessary for different roles. Ensuring inclusivity means critical messages reach all staff, regardless of their work environment. In incidents, this can make the difference between a rapid, coordinated response and a fragmented one.

Advanced Tasks

Develop and test an incident communication playbook.
Having pre-drafted templates, stakeholder contact lists, and regulatory notification procedures saves valuable time in a crisis. A tested playbook ensures responses are consistent and reduce the risk of errors under stress. Regular exercises reveal weaknesses, such as unclear responsibilities or outdated contact information. Updating the playbook based on lessons learned strengthens organizational readiness.

Build secure communication channels for crisis response.
In serious incidents, normal systems like email may be compromised, so alternative channels are essential. Secure, encrypted platforms and out-of-band communication methods allow response teams to coordinate safely. Testing these systems ensures they function when needed and that staff know how to access them. A reliable crisis channel builds resilience and confidence during high-pressure events.

Establish external communication protocols.
Stakeholders such as regulators, clients, and the media expect timely, accurate updates during incidents. Preparing clear protocols for who communicates externally, what messages are approved, and when disclosures occur avoids inconsistency and misinformation. Aligning these protocols with compliance and legal teams helps avoid regulatory penalties or reputational missteps. Practiced protocols demonstrate professionalism and control even in a crisis.

Conduct communication drills alongside incident response.
Cybersecurity exercises should test not just technical containment but also how effectively teams communicate across departments. Running drills where communication is measured for speed, clarity, and accuracy exposes real-world challenges. This ensures that technical responders, executives, and communications teams work in sync under pressure. Regular drills help build muscle memory and confidence across the organization.

Align communication with regulatory requirements.
Many regulations now mandate disclosure of incidents within specific timeframes, often as short as 72 hours. Mapping these obligations in advance ensures the right information is collected and disseminated without delays. Practicing these workflows prevents regulatory fines and reduces the scramble during real incidents. Meeting requirements reliably also builds trust with regulators and demonstrates maturity.

Leverage metrics to improve communication effectiveness.
Organizations should measure how quickly messages are delivered, whether staff acknowledge them, and how well instructions are understood. Collecting feedback highlights gaps, such as overly technical language or unclear escalation steps. Regularly reviewing metrics ensures communication strategies evolve with organizational needs. Over time, this creates a feedback loop that continuously improves clarity and engagement.

Do you also want me to suggest a statistic here (like % of breaches worsened by poor internal comms, or % of firms fined for late regulatory notification) for use in a graphic?
