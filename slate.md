🇬🇧 UK Data (Use and Access) Act 2025 – Info Sheet

📝 What Happened?

The Data (Use and Access) Act 2025 (DUAA) received Royal Assent on 19 June 2025, introducing sweeping reforms to the UK’s data protection landscape. It amends the UK GDPR, the Data Protection Act 2018 (DPA 2018), and the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations (PECR), aiming to reduce compliance burdens, encourage data-driven innovation, and boost digital infrastructure (including smart data and digital identity). The Act preserves many EU-style rights and principles, but formalises divergence in areas like international data transfers, automated decision-making, and cookies. Key provisions will be phased in through secondary legislation across 2025–26.

🧍 Affected Entities

The DUAA applies to a broad spectrum of organisations that process personal data in the UK. While many reforms reduce compliance friction, they also require proactive updates to internal policies, legal bases, and data governance strategies.

Private-sector businesses processing customer, user, or employee data.

Technology and AI developers using automation or machine learning on UK data.

Regulated industries (e.g. energy, finance, telecom) participating in smart data schemes.

Public bodies handling civil registration, digital identity, or public infrastructure data.

Cross-border firms relying on UK–EU data flows or international transfers.

Online platforms and marketers using cookies, analytics, or targeting tools.

🔄 Notable Shifts in Obligations

Change	Description

Legitimate Interests Expanded	- Introduces a new lawful basis: “recognised legitimate interests” (e.g., national security, crime prevention, safeguarding). <br> - These uses don’t require a balancing test. <br> - Clarifies other routine use cases like fraud prevention and IT security that often qualify.
Automated Decision‑Making (ADM)	- Broader use permitted without consent for non-special category data. <br> - Safeguards required where decisions have legal or significant effects: <ul><li>Notice to individuals</li><li>Right to human review</li><li>Right to challenge</li></ul> <br> - Special category ADM still restricted.
Cookies and Tracking Technologies	- Consent no longer needed for first-party analytics, fraud prevention, and authentication cookies. <br> - Consent still required for advertising and profiling cookies. <br> - Allows simpler banners and improved UX compliance.
Subject Access Requests (SARs)	- Adds “stop-the-clock” mechanism when requests lack clarity or sufficient info. <br> - Codifies reasonable/proportionate search limits. <br> - Helps prevent abuse of SAR rights.
Scientific Research	- Defines “scientific research” to include academic, industrial, and commercial uses. <br> - Permits broad consent for future unspecified research. <br> - Allows limited data subject notice where it’s disproportionate.
Children’s Data Protection	- Introduces new obligations for “higher protection matters” when services are likely accessed by children. <br> - Requires organisations to consider age-appropriate design and safeguards.
Smart Data Schemes Introduced	- Enables government-mandated data portability in regulated sectors. <br> - Empowers consumers to share data with authorised third parties. <br> - Supports fairer pricing, product switching, and competition.
International Data Transfers	- Lowers standard for adequacy: “not materially lower” replaces “essentially equivalent.” <br> - Removes 4-year adequacy review—ongoing risk monitoring instead. <br> - Adds new emergency transfer pathways, including for law enforcement.
Purpose Limitation Clarified	- Defines when further processing is “compatible” with original purpose. <br> - Allows reuse for law enforcement, legal obligations, or public interest scenarios. <br> - Enables non-disclosure if informing data subjects is disproportionate.
Regulatory Reform: ICO to Information Commission	- ICO becomes the Information Commission. <br> - Secretary of State can issue binding guidance and strategic direction. <br> - Aligns PECR penalties (e.g., cookie violations) with GDPR levels: up to £17.5M or 4% of global turnover.
Complaints Handling Requirements	- Mandates electronic channels for data complaints. <br> - Requires prompt acknowledgments and breach follow-up procedures.
Law Enforcement and National Security Provisions	- Adds exemptions for legal professional privilege and national security. <br> - Allows joint data controllership between law enforcement/intelligence. <br> - Removes logging requirements for routine enforcement activities.
