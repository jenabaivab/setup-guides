i think we have to go with 1 sentence for the what how and impact. it's getting too big

Here is the revised two-slide content for the Marks & Spencer ransomware case, with each of What, How, and Impact limited to one concise sentence suitable for executive slides:

***

### Slide 1: Marks & Spencer Ransomware Case Study  
**What:**  
Marks & Spencer experienced a ransomware attack in April 2025 that took their online sales offline and compromised sensitive customer data.

**How:**  
Attackers gained access by socially engineering a third-party helpdesk employee and then deployed ransomware after stealing admin credentials.

**Impact:**  
The breach resulted in an estimated £300 million in lost profits and widespread customer data exposure, damaging the brand’s trust.

### Slide 2: Marks & Spencer Ransomware Lessons  
**What Went Wrong:**  
- Weak helpdesk verification enabled social engineering attacks.  
- Lack of monitoring allowed undetected credential theft.  
- Employee training did not address advanced phishing techniques.

**Defensive Takeaways:**  
- Enforce strong identity verification and anti-social engineering protocols.  
- Implement real-time monitoring for credential access and lateral movement.  
- Conduct ongoing simulated phishing training to improve staff vigilance.
