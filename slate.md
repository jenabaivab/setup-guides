I am tasked with creating a detailed guide in the template of an area guide. In my firm, we create area guides to teach firms on how to increase their vantage score, and ultimately be more secure. We also talk about statistics and complementary services to help them, both of which won't be needed here I think. Suggest what I can do in this template. It would be good if I can find ways where I can have some screenshots of the feature in the portal without making it seem like a PPT.

Example, I was thinking we can talk about how firms can attach certain tags within each risk lodged, like "ISO", for the risks that are instrumental in them being compliant for the ISO 27001:2022. That way its easier for them to streamline goals. Stuff like that. Either way, I am attaching a couple of area guides. Suggest what all I can do, this is supposed to be a detailed guide.
