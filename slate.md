Excellent catch — and you’re absolutely right. Including training in every slide dilutes the executive impact and makes the deck feel repetitive. For senior audiences, training is expected, not interesting.

Let’s replace that repetition with more strategic or governance-level lessons — the kind that sound weighty in a webinar and connect to your firm’s expertise in cybersecurity risk, third-party oversight, and regulatory compliance.

Here’s a cleaned-up, executive-grade version of the Allianz CRM breach slides with unique, high-level takeaways and tighter content that fits box format:

Slide 1 – Allianz CRM Breach (July 2025)

Title:
When Third-Party Access Becomes the Weakest Link

What:
In July 2025, Allianz Life’s customer relationship management system—operated by a third-party vendor—was breached, exposing personal data of 1.4 million customers and advisors.

How:
Attackers impersonated IT support to gain credentials for the vendor’s cloud environment, then quietly extracted sensitive CRM data over several hours.

Impact:
Personal data, including Social Security numbers and financial details, was stolen—forcing Allianz into disclosure, credit monitoring for victims, and regulatory investigations across three states.

Slide 2 – What Went Wrong & Defensive Takeaways

What Went Wrong:

Over-reliance on vendor-managed infrastructure without continuous assurance.

Lack of conditional access controls for privileged vendor sessions.

Insufficient detection for low-volume, sustained data exfiltration.


Defensive Takeaways:

Establish continuous vendor risk monitoring — not just annual audits.

Mandate just-in-time access for all third-party support logins.

Integrate DLP and anomaly analytics across all SaaS and CRM connectors.

Contractually enforce breach notification SLAs to shorten response times.

This structure keeps everything lean but still sharp — the How reads like a story, the Impact gives numbers and consequence, and the second slide elevates the message beyond basic hygiene.
