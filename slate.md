Cool ‚Äî here are the trend + first-case slides for Trend 5: Ecosystem Amplification ‚Äî Shared SaaS & Supply Chain Cascades, using the United Natural Foods Inc. (UNFI) / Whole Foods Market incident.

üåê Trend 5 ‚Äì Ecosystem Amplification: Shared SaaS & Supply Chain Cascades

Title:
When one breach disrupts thousands

Bullets:

A single supplier or platform outage can ripple across entire industries, affecting retailers, consumers and downstream suppliers.

Shared systems (ordering, invoicing, distribution) become chokepoints ‚Äî attackers hitting one node can paralyze many.

Recovery is harder because manual workarounds inside supply chains are complex and slow.


Scary Stat:
üö® A June 2025 cyberincident at UNFI disrupted supply to over 30,000 stores, including Whole Foods, causing visible empty shelves nationwide.

üß© Slide 1 ‚Äì UNFI / Whole Foods Supply Chain Cascade (June 2025)

Title:
When a Distributor Goes Offline, So Do Thousands of Stores

What:
On June 5, 2025, UNFI detected unauthorized activity in its IT systems and proactively took critical ordering and invoicing platforms offline. 

How:
The outage forced the company to revert to manual processes across inventory, ordering and supply logistics ‚Äî causing delays across its 50+ distribution centers. 

Impact:
More than 30,000 retail locations experienced supply disruptions, empty shelves appeared across stores, and UNFI projected a US$350-400 million hit for fiscal 2025.

üß† Slide 2 ‚Äì What Went Wrong & Defensive Takeaways

What Went Wrong:

Reliance on centralized digital ordering/invoicing platforms created a single point of failure.

Lack of resilient backup workflows meant switching to manual was slow and inefficient.

The disruption affected not only UNFI but cascaded through retailers, suppliers, and end customers.


Defensive Takeaways:

Map ecosystem dependencies: know which shared systems (SaaS or distribution) are critical for partners.

Design redundant channels: build alternate ordering and logistics workflows that can go manual quickly.

Stress-test supply chain continuity: run breach / outage simulations involving upstream distributors.

Contractually require business continuity & cyber resilience from key suppliers.

If you like, I can draft both slides for a second case (maybe another supply-chain / SaaS cascade example) so you have two case slides under this trend also.
