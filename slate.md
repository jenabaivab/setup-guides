Thanks — that’s a strong and detailed source. Based on your manager’s suggestion, I’ll widen the scope slightly to “Cyber Training and User Awareness,” focusing on both formal training programs and day-to-day user behavior (phishing, social engineering, reinforcement, etc.).

I’ll now create the area guide in the correct template style — just like your Managing Items of Interest sample — and keep it tight, practical, and tailored for Cyber for Health clients (wealth managers).

Cyber Training and User Awareness

Human behavior is one of the most common entry points for cyber incidents. From phishing emails to accidental data mishandling, many cyberattacks succeed not because of a failure in technology, but because users weren’t prepared to recognize or respond to threats. For wealth managers, where sensitive financial data and client trust are central to the business, the stakes are especially high.

A well-designed training and awareness program can significantly reduce human-related risk. It builds a culture of cyber vigilance, ensures employees understand their responsibilities, and equips them to act decisively in the face of real-world threats. Without such a program, firms may find that even the most robust technical controls are undermined by poor day-to-day user behavior.

After establishing your baseline training needs, there are several critical steps to develop and sustain user awareness across the firm: »	Define goals and tailor training content to real-world risks.
»	Deliver training in formats and frequencies that fit your risk profile.
»	Enforce attendance and track understanding through assessments.
»	Reinforce awareness through ongoing testing and internal messaging.
»	Embed secure behavior into workflows and reporting practices.
»	Deliver specialized training for high-risk roles.

Step-by-Step Breakdown

	Set Goals Based on Real Risks
Start by identifying what you want to achieve with your training and awareness program. Use findings from cyber risk assessments or past incidents to pinpoint areas of concern — whether that’s phishing, password hygiene, secure file sharing, or data classification. Training goals should clearly tie back to actual risk and align with the firm’s broader security strategy.

	Offer the Right Format, at the Right Frequency
Training should be accessible, engaging, and regular. Most employees should receive training at onboarding and annually thereafter. However, those in sensitive roles — such as IT, compliance, or client service — may require more frequent or specialized instruction. Consider a mix of formats (e.g. web-based modules, live sessions, or simulations) based on your firm’s resources and culture.

	Track Participation and Measure Understanding
It’s not enough to require training — you need to ensure it’s being absorbed. Track attendance and build in short assessments (like quizzes or phishing simulations) to confirm retention. Employees who perform poorly should be flagged for follow-up. Participation should be enforced, with clear messaging about why it matters and how it supports the firm’s overall risk posture.

	Reinforce Learning with Phishing Tests and Messaging
Formal training alone won’t sustain awareness. Use mock phishing campaigns, periodic alerts, or internal newsletters to keep cybersecurity top of mind. Test results provide useful data on firm-wide behavior and can identify trends or departments needing extra attention. Employees who fall for simulated attacks should receive targeted re-training.

	Make Secure Behavior Part of the Workflow
Training should connect to real tools and actions. For example, if password management is part of the curriculum, ensure employees are shown how to use the company’s password manager — and encourage that usage as standard practice. Similarly, if phishing reporting is encouraged, make sure the process is simple, clear, and emphasized in the training itself.

	Provide Role-Specific Training Where Needed
Employees with access to sensitive financial or personal data — such as client advisors, portfolio managers, or IT admins — often face more targeted threats. Deliver training tailored to the risks these individuals are most likely to encounter. This also helps address any regulatory requirements tied to specific data types (e.g. PII or GDPR-related handling obligations).
