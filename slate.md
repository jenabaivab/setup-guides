Here is the **cleanest layout** (with exact box placement) that fits *your non-redundant content* in a **single A4/PPT slide** without feeling crowded.

This layout is designed for **security one-pagers**, where you need clarity, hierarchy, and strong visual structure.

---

# ⭐ **FINAL ONE-PAGER LAYOUT (WITH BOXES)**

*(Designed specifically for the content we finalized — everything fits cleanly.)*

---

# 🔲 **BOX 1 — Top Left (Small Box — 20% width)**

### **AT A GLANCE**

(4–5 lines only)

* Outstanding actions: **56**
* Categories: Apps (43), Identity (8), Data (5)
* Regressions: **1**
* License blockers: **1**

**Dimensions:**
Narrow vertical box; top-left; takes ~20–25% of width.
Keeps the page balanced.

---

# 🔲 **BOX 2 — Top Right (Large Box — 75% width)**

### **CATEGORY DISTRIBUTION**

(3-row table only)

| Category     | Count | Typical Controls      | Notes          |
| ------------ | ----- | --------------------- | -------------- |
| **Apps**     | 43    | Email & collaboration | Largest volume |
| **Identity** | 8     | MFA, risk policies    | High-impact    |
| **Data**     | 5     | DLP, labeling         | Least gaps     |

**Dimensions:**
Runs across the top-right, roughly 75% width, shallow height.
Balances the “At a Glance” box and keeps the top section lightweight.

---

# 🔲 **BOX 3 — Middle Row (Full Width, Medium Height)**

### **HIGHEST-VALUE OUTSTANDING ITEMS**

(Grouped to avoid redundancy)

1. **Impersonation protection suite** (8-point items)
2. **Identity Protection policies** (7-point items; one regressed)
3. **Phishing-resistant MFA for admins**
4. **Impersonation quarantine policies** (6-point items)
5. **On-prem AD password protection** (6 points)

**Dimensions:**
Full-width box
Sits directly under Box 1 & 2.
Keep this *medium* height — 5 bullet lines maximum.

---

# 🔲 **BOX 4 — Bottom Left (Half width)**

### **THEMATIC WEAKNESSES**

(Interprets the data — stays concise)

**Identity**

* Incomplete MFA
* Risk policies disabled + regression
* Weak admin session controls

**Apps**

* Missing impersonation defenses
* Weak Safe Links / anti-phishing
* Loose sharing + Teams governance

**Data**

* No DLP
* No labeling / auto-classification

**Dimensions:**
Left half of lower section.
This is a dense but compact block — keep bullets short.

---

# 🔲 **BOX 5 — Bottom Right (Half width)**

### **30-DAY PRIORITY PLAN**

(Only 2–3 bullets per category)

**Identity (Week 1)**

* Restore risk policy
* Complete MFA
* Enforce admin MFA

**Apps (Week 1–3)**

* Deploy impersonation suite
* Enable Safe Links
* Restrict forwarding & sharing
* Harden Teams settings

**Data (Week 3–4)**

* Enable baseline DLP
* Publish sensitivity labels
* Begin auto-labeling

**Dimensions:**
Right half of lower section.
Matches the height of Box 4 for symmetry.

# 🎯 **WHY THIS LAYOUT WORKS PERFECTLY**

* Top row is “metadata” → visually light
* Middle box carries the important “what actually matters” content
* Bottom row splits “analysis” and “action”
* NO duplication
* Boxes are balanced and symmetrical
* It prints cleanly on A4 and looks clean in PPT
* Allows breathing room, white space, and avoids clutter

If you'd like, I can now:

✅ Create a **PPT-ready version** (formatted text)
or
✅ Build this as a **canvas template** you can reuse for all clients.

Which one do you want?
