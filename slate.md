My manager recommended making it a bit broader - she said we could build it out into more user behavior and awareness so combine training and reference things like phishing, etc.


Why it Matters 

Cybersecurity research has established that up to 88% of data breaches occur as a direct result of human error. However, despite the outsized role a human factor plays in cyber-attacks, most companies fail to give sufficient attention to training and awareness to reduce risk. Consequently, users are vulnerable to attacks that utilize methods aiming to exploit human errors, and many malicious groups use methods rooted in social engineering precisely for this reason. Establishing an effective training program that takes into account existing risks and encourages further understanding of cybersecurity threats can significantly reduce the risk a business is exposed to.

How to Lower Risk 

Essential Components

	Establish Goals for Cybersecurity Awareness Training
Businesses should first establish what they seek to accomplish by instituting a cybersecurity awareness training program. Identify the key cybersecurity risks the company is exposed to and what role the human factor plays within those risks. An effective training program would be built around assessment of risk – define what topics are most relevant and what resources are available for the development of a program that addresses those items. Defined goals are also necessary to establish what is being addressed through training to assess the effectiveness of the program (please see our Area Guide on User Behavior Testing and Analysis).

	Determine How and When the Training Will be Offered
How a company chooses to offer cybersecurity awareness training may differ based on a business’ needs and available resources. It is important to consider whether in-person training might be suitable for your business, or whether a web-based format would be best. Confirm if the company has the resources to develop and administer cybersecurity awareness training through an internal team, or if an external provider is being brought in to administer it. Based on the company’s risk landscape and further risk assessments, the training frequency may be greater or lower. Ideally, formal training would be offered to a majority of employees at onboarding, with a refresher at least yearly, with higher risk positions potentially receiving training with greater frequency to accommodate those needs. In addition to the cycle of formal training, regular messaging and other measures (such as mock phishing campaigns) should be used to keep awareness of risk high.

	Update Training Periodically
Cybersecurity is a rapidly developing field, and new threats and strategies are developed by malicious actors with relative frequency, so a static program may not be able to properly prepare attendees to identify and face developing threats in the cybersecurity space. Organizations should ensure training programs are assessed against current threat landscapes to best prepare their staff against the kinds of threats they may be faced with. Whether an internal security team develops training programs for an organization, or whether cyber security training is entrusted to a third-party provider, organizations should ensure they consult with subject matter experts to confirm the currency of the recommendations made during the training, as well as the likely effectiveness of such training. Training programs should be periodically updated as new threats and strategies develop. 

	Ensure Attendance to Training is Enforced and Understanding is Assessed
Companies should employ means to ensure attendance is tracked and encouraged. Penalties should be put in effect should an employee fail to attend a required training. Establish communications around the training to ensure employees are fully aware of the importance of their participation. Similarly, assessments for effectiveness should be built into the program to confirm whether those who attend the training synthesize the information covered. Quizzes built into the end of a training course (or throughout the training process) are the most common and simplest way to assess whether employees understand the information presented, but there are always other practical tests that a business may consider. A phishing test administered either through an internal team or a specialized third-party vendor, for example, would present useful data regarding the company employees’ preparedness to identify and respond to similar attacks from actual malicious actors.

Advanced Components

	Reinforce Key Points from Training
Requiring the completion of a short training program each year can be very effective, but to ensure the preparedness of your organization it is important to foster additional awareness for cybersecurity threats and potential risks. Organizations should consider increasing the frequency of any formal training offerings or scaling up refresher messaging on key training points throughout the year beyond formal training. Employees who fail tests meant to assess understanding of cyber risk and policies covered during training (such as phishing tests) should face consequences – whether additional, one on one training, or more disciplinary measures. Internal newsletters can be useful for disseminating updated and relevant information regarding potential cybersecurity threats an organization may face. 

	Build Training Practices Into a Workflow
A training program can only be effective if processes within the company enable employees to adhere to those best practices and use their training. Employees should be made familiar with resources the company has that would enable them to adhere to best practices – for example, if password management is a key topic introduced during training, and the company has access to password management applications, employees should receive training on how to take advantage of those applications and should be incentivized to make the use of such applications part of their daily workflow. If there are specific avenues in place to allow employees to report suspicious activity (such as phishing emails received), the reporting process should be emphasized in training as part of a clear workflow that employees can easily follow and adhere to. 

	Determine Whether Specific Training Practices are Needed for Specialized Roles
Organizations should assess whether any of their employees present a greater risk through their positions. Many departments in an organization will have access to data and systems not available to most employees, and companies should ensure that staff in those roles determined to be of higher risk are familiar with cyber threats specific to their positions. Roles with access to privileged or sensitive information (such as financial information, personal data, or intellectual property), or IT staff with significant system access, are an example to be of higher risk. Role-specific training may also be compliance driven – roles which handle personally identifiable information for example would require training to meet compliance standards regarding PII, such as GDPR training.
